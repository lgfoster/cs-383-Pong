# **Pong the Game - Made in Unity**
## **Quick Play**
* To play this game, first clone the repo with ``` git clone https://github.com/lgfoster/cs-383-Pong.git pong_unity```

   * A .zip can also be downloaded by clicking the green Code button on the upper right of the webpage.

* Execute the cs383-pong.exe within the file to run the game.
            
 
## **How to Play:**

* This game supports two players and both pattles can be controlled via:
   * Left Paddle: "w" and "s" keys to move paddle up and down on left of screen
   * Right Paddle: "up" and "down" keys to move paddle up and down on right of screen
* Serve the ball by pressing "space"
* The game can be paused by pressing "p" and can be quit by pressing "escape"

## **Create New Build**
Code can be edited through Unity to generate a new build of the game by doing the following:
1. Clone this repo using ``` git clone https://github.com/lgfoster/cs-383-Pong.git pong_unity``` or download the zip
2. Open Unity or download Unity from https://unity.com/download
    * Follow Unity's download guide 
    * Once the Unity hub is downloaded, install the latest Unity 2021.3.16 build
3. In the Unity Hub, click "Open" and open the location of the Pong Folder that the repo was cloned to or the file was unzipped to
4. Once the file is open in Unity Editor, all files, assets and scripts can be accessed through the bottom window in the editor
    * Note: All C# scripts used in this game are stored within the Assets folder 
5. After editing the scripts and game is done, create a new build of the game by clicking the file button on the upper left corner of the editor and then selecting Build and Run
6. Unity will then compile the entire project (this will usually take a while) and generate a new executable game file, along with a .dll and MonoBleedingEdge folder
7. Now the game is complete and can be ran with the new executable!

## **How to Install Unity**
1. Start by downloading the Unity Hub from https://unity.com/download
    1. Choose the Windows platform to download and then click the ``` UnityHubSetup.exe ```
2. After installing, accept the User Terms and License Agreement
3. Unity Hub will then ask about which editor versions and assets to install
    1. Select ``` Unity 2021.3.16f1 ``` as this was the version of Unity Editor this game was built with
    2. The installer will then ask about which modules to install. Choose ones that are desireable for your build
          * Note: I would recommend downloading the Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 module, as this can make coding easier
4. Installing the editor and additional assets will take time. After the installation, click on the Installs tab in the Unity Hub to confirm the editor and asset installations
5. Once the installs have been confirmed, Unity has officially been installed on your computer!
